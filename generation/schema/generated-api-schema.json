    "description": " An Application in FreeClimb is just a set of configuration data and URLs that FreeClimb invokes to notify the app of an event or to retrieve instructions on how to behave in response to an event, such as when one of the phone numbers associated with the Application receives a Call. Applications are useful for encapsulating configuration information that we need to distribute across multiple phone numbers. Any number of phone numbers can point to a single Application so that they share a common set of properties and URLs. This makes it possible to change the configuration of a large number of phone numbers by modifying a single Application instance. If we create an Application with its voiceUrl set to http://www.example.com/answer, we can assign that Application to all of our incoming phone numbers and FreeClimb will make a request to that URL whenever an inbound call arrives. Likewise, when making outbound calls using the REST API, we can specify an applicationId to handle the outbound request and FreeClimb will make a request to the callConnectUrl of the Application. The callConnectUrl property is used instead of the voiceUrl property for outbound calls. The behavior of the callConnectUrl and voiceUrl are different because of the difference in ‘behavior’ when making an outbound call and answering an inbound call; the main difference being that an outbound call may not actually be connected (e.g. busy, no answer). For incoming SMS messages, we can specify an smsUrl which FreeClimb will request when a number assigned to our Application receives an SMS message.

    "description": " The Conference instance resource represents a connection between two or more Calls. A Conference must be created explicitly. You logically cannot add a participant to a conference that does not exist. A conference is created either through the CreateConference PerCL command or through the REST API by posting to the /Conferences endpoint. For more information about Conferences created through PerCL, see Conferences. The statusCallbackUrl attribute in CreateConference and /Conferences POST request are invoked as needed to inform the application of all conference status transitions. When a conference is successfully created, the statusCallbackUrl is invoked to inform the application of its conferenceId and its new empty state. In this state, conference actions such as Say or Play are not possible. No wait music plays and no recording occurs when a conference is empty. A conference is no longer empty when at least one call/participant joins. Once populated, commands such as Say and Play to the conference can execute and wait music will start to play and will continue to play until the conference has started (status = inProgress). Only participants with listen privileges can hear the wait music. The start of a conference (status = inProgress) occurs when at least one participant is a start-moderator. A start-moderator is one who has the startConfOnEnter flag set. In FreeClimb, there can be any number of start-moderators. Recording of a conference also starts when a conference starts. Note that conference recording option must be enabled at the time of creation of the conference. A conference ends and returns to the empty status when the last participant leaves the conference. If recording of the conference active, the recording ends when the conference ends. The application may choose to terminate the Conference resource or to leave it empty for reuse. It is possible to repopulate an empty conference with participants. Such reuse is possible up until the time the conference is terminated using the Conference POST method with status = terminated or the use of the TerminateConference PerCL command. When terminated, a conference is first emptied of its participants and is then archived to the FreeClimb database. The ID of an archived conference will not be reused by FreeClimb when creating another conference. Note that terminating a conference doesn't delete the Conference resource from the account that owns it.
